## 🔍 Key Findings

### 🌿 Emissions Intensity Trends

* **📉 NEM-Wide Decline**:
  Emissions intensity dropped **29%**, from **0.84 → 0.60 tCO₂-e/MWh** (2011–2024).
  Driven by **renewables growth** and **coal retirements**.

* **📍 Regional Reductions**:

  * **Tasmania & SA**: >70% reduction — driven by hydro & wind
  * **Victoria & Queensland**: Lagging — <25% reduction due to coal reliance

* **📅 Seasonal Variation**:

  * Winter peaks: 0.62–0.67 tCO₂-e/MWh
  * Spring/Summer lows: 0.54–0.56 tCO₂-e/MWh
  * Renewables reduce seasonal swings
